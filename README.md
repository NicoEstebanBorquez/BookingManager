# BookingManager
 I'have developed this Java project after finishing my first year in CFGS Desarrollo de Aplicaciones Multiplataforma (Senior Technician Multi Platform Application Development). 
 I've included in this project what I've learned about JAVA and SQL durings this course. 
 
 
 This software has been created to help small property management companies to manage their bookings, accomodations and customers.
